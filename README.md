# group7-group-assignment-

This is the repository of our group project of course Analytical Customer Relationship Management in UGent. This project is about how can we improve the reputation of NMBS, the national railway company of Belgium, via statistical analysis. 

In our project, we answered the 21 base questions in the src folder. The extra insights were
just added directly in the base questions. 

In src/data_procesing, the data.py file does all the data preprocessing, which we load in each question.
In src/utils, we have some functions or dicionaties that we use in the datapreprocessing
In src/bin_unused_files, we put all the old_versions, or test files that we do not use anymore. 

The used datasets are all in the Data folder.
The Documents folder contains our assignment and data description.
