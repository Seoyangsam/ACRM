This is the repository of our group project of course Analytical Customer Relationship Management in UGent. This project is about how can we improve the reputation of NMBS, the national railway company of Belgium, via statistical analysis. 

Following questions were answered: 
2. Plot the average delay time per provider (EUROSTAR, NMBS, THALYS).
3. Plot the number of stations per city for cities with multiple stations.
4. Plot the number of stations per city in function of number of inhabitants.
5. Plot the distribution of delay times.
6. Plot how the average delay time evolves through the week
7. Plot how this delay time evolves across the day for the five most used stations in Belgium.
8. Plot all Belgian stations on a map of Belgium.
9. Plot all train routes on a map.
10. Are some train routes more likely to experience delays than others? Visualize and proof
statistically.
11. Plot how the number of stations differs across Belgian provinces using a color-coded heat
map. Do the same while adjusting for the number of inhabitants.
12. Which cities are the worst with regard to access to train facilities? You can do this by
calculating the travel distance, travel time, ... Would you recommend based on this, and the
visualization in Q5, to create some new routes?
13. Cluster the stations based on facilities. What type of stations exist? Are some stations ‘odd’
in the facilities they provide? What would you suggest to do with these? Is there a
correlation between station type and number of daily trains?
14. Determine unique facilities that are very rare in orders of prevalence. Infer what may cause
these facilities to be in place on their current locations. Are there possible other stations that
could benefit from these facilities?
15. Plot the average delay time in function of the number of train rides per hour. Does there
seem to be a correlation?
16. Is delay determined by possible delay in the previous station? (Hint: this is a form of
autocorrelation).
17. Regress the number of facilities to both the number of daily trains and number of daily
travelers. Do this using two univariate regressions and determine which covariate is the
primary driver for number of facilities, based on the adequate goodness-of-fit measure.
18. Extreme delays heavily impact our business model. Visualize how these are distributed, both
per incident type and geographical location. Are there any incident types / locations that we
should pay special attention to? What actions would you recommend?
19. Last year we conducted a survey per station on how satisfied the average traveler is. We
observed some large differences to exist, but are puzzled on what causes this. Proof
statistically which combined influence certain factors may have. (Hint: plotting relationships
can help in deducting early which factors do (not) influence satisfaction score). Make use of
multivariate techniques.
20. In marketing there is a common phenomenon called ‘the long tail’ (look it up!). Are you able
to observe similar patterns in this dataset with regard to the number of stops, number of
daily travelers, etc.?
21. We can clearly observe a weekend-effect in the number of daily travelers? However, some
stations experience more travelers during the weekend. Which stations are this? Plot them
on a map of Belgium and try to deduct a reasoning to what causes these stations to observe
an opposed effect?
22. Cluster stations based on week-weekend distribution of travelers (hint: consider rescaling).
Do you observe similar clusters to the ones observed with regard to facilities-based
clustering?
