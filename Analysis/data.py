# Most remarkable differences are between Brussels Midi and Brussels North. North is in the middle of business centre ==> attracts many commuters during the week while Brussels Midi is the most important international railway station of Belgium and thus attracts many tourists. Also notice how Antwerpen and Leuven almost have equal travellers during the week and are off by almost a factor two during the weekend. This could signify a more or less equal commute potential but a far greater touristic potential for Antwerp. However, both are edjucated guesses based on my personal knowledge about the country. Implementing this mathematical and on a larger scale requires external data!

# Other explanations for the commute numbers may possible lay in the number of facilities. As a proof of concept, let's try to mathematically proof whether weekly commute numbers are linked to availabilty of free parking and/or tram stations nearby. To do so, we will link the facilities and travelers datasets. We will impute missing values of free parking and tram with these facilities not being available. However, do note that this is not necessarily the best assumption!

facilities['free_parking'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
facilities['tram'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

# ASSUMPTION: travelers is subset of facilities

# convert to lower case
facilities['name'] = facilities['name'].str.lower()
travelers['Station'] = travelers['Station'].str.lower()

# check overlap
len(list(set(facilities['name']).intersection(set(travelers['Station']))))

# around 80 which will need manual imputation
intersection = list(set(facilities['name']).intersection(set(travelers['Station'])))

still_needed = set(travelers['Station']).difference(intersection)

len(still_needed)

still_needed

facility_names = set(facilities['name']).difference(intersection)

# The facilities dateset also includes international stations, more small stations and different names for the stations with bilingual names or more complicated names. We will have to impute these manually. I will do some, but you will have to create a dictionary of all linked names in order to impute those names.

# dictionary with correct names
Dict = dict({'antwerpen-caal': 'antwerpen-centraal',
             'arcades': 'arcaden/arcades',
             'beignee': 'beign√©e',
             'berchem-st-ag.-berchem': 'sint-agatha-berchem/berchem-sainte-agathe'})

# replace names
travelers = travelers.replace({"Station": Dict})

# check if overlap +4 (previously overlap = 473)
len(list(set(facilities['name']).intersection(set(travelers['Station']))))

# Overlap has increased by four. These four are the four stations I have mapped out.

# Let's assume we have imputed all station names. Now we can merge the two datasets and run an analysis to see whether tram and free parking availability correlate to the number of travelers on a weekday. Do note that the relationship can be bi-directional. People can be inclined to use stations with connection to trams, but public transport companies can also be more likely to link their network with popular train stations.

merge = pd.merge(facilities, travelers, left_on='name', right_on='Station')

# To perform a multivariate regression, we will use the statsmodels package. Note that sklearn (which you will use later on in the course) also has an implementation of the model. However, sklearn focuses more on predictive performance (how good you can predict something) instead of statistical inference. Since we are interested whether relationships are significant, we will use statsmodels in this case
